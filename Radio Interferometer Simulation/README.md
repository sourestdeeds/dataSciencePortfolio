# Radio Interferometer Simulation

## Introduction
***
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
 The VLA hosts 27 antennas, with each one comprising of a 25 meter dish housing 8 receivers with a weight of 209 metric tonnes. The dishes move across three arms of a track, on an altitude-azimuth mount, in the shape of a Y configuration. Using the specially designed lifting train (Heins Train), the array can extend and contract to four different configurations throughout the course of 16 months, allowing aperture synthesis interferometry of up to 351 baselines.  At its maximum, the extension is akin to the optical zoom on a camera, able to resolve detail across further distance. In this configuration, the VLA lengthens each of its legs from two-thirds of a mile to 23 miles long. Configuration A is the largest, and for this project we will be working with the smallest of the list, configuration D.
