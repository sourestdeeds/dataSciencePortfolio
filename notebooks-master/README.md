# Notebooks

This repo contains the Jupyter notebooks I post to my blog, [jessicastringham.net](https://jessicastringham.net).

    # create environment of your choice, for example
    virtualenv -p python3 venv
    
    # install requirements
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    # run notebook
    jupyter notebook
