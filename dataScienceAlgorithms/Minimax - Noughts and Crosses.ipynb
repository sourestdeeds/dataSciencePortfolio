    "## Minimax background\n",
    "\n",
    "(This Jupyter cell is irrelevant, just flavour for those who want it)\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimax algorithm is attributed to John von Neumann (1928, `Zur Theorie der Gesellschaftsspiele`), but its key features were described earlier by Émile Borel (1921, `La théorie du jeu et les équations intégrales à noyau symétrique`). It has also been sugested that Charles Babbage may have known about the algorithm. Irregardless of who formalised it, anyone who has ever played Draughts, Chess, Go, or countless other games, has used it. At any point in the game you choose your next move by thinking several ahead, and considering what you and your opponent will do to maximise their respective chances of winning. In the formal version 'several ahead' means all the way to the very end, where one of you has won.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimax is an algorithm of game theory (a term invented by von Neumann with Morgenstern), which formalises how to act when you are in competition with others (If you want to know more then `The Joy of Game Theory` by  `Presh Talwalkar` is a friendly introduction). The basic version introduced here is for finding the optimal move in _zero sum_ games that are _turn based_ with _two players_ where everything is _deterministic_ and _observable_, and you have enough computation/memory to exhaust the _search tree_. To define these terms:\n",
    " * zero sum: There are n points to be won and they are distributed between the players at the end of the game. In other words, there is no possibility of cooperation, and one players fortune is anther's loss. Any game where one player wins and the other loses satisfies this; a draw is half the points to each player.\n",
    " * turn based: Players take turns to make a move.\n",
    " * two player: There are two players!\n",
    " * deterministic: No dice. The consequence of any action is known, exactly.\n",
    " * observable: No secrets, so both players know everything.\n",
    " * search tree: This is every possible state the game can be in, and the transitions (moves) between them made by the players.\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimax algorithm is solving the _Nash equilibrium_ (Its discovery is the subject of the film _A Beautiful Mind_ (2001)) for games with the above properties. Note that many of the above properties can be relaxed with more sophisticated versions. Even when it can't approximations are used: Alpha Go used minimax to beat homosapiens at Go, but never could have held the entire search tree of Go in memory; that would be more states than there are atoms in the universe... even after you bulked up by replacing every atom with a copy of the universe. Instead, it used machine learning to estimate what the probability of winning from any state was, so it didn't have to search to the end."

    "## Minimax explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "(This Jupyter cell is irrelevant, as you don't need to understand the algorithm. Great algorithm however!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimax is best understood by starting at the end of a game. Imagine the board looks like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "o|x|x\n",
    " |x|o\n",
    "o|x|\n",
    "```\n",
    "The game has ended, and `x` has won. Lets say that the value is `+1` when `x` wins, `-1` when `y` wins, and `0` for a draw. So this state (of the board) has a score of `+1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key to minimax is the realisation that if we can assign a score to the end states then we can assign a score to any other state by assuming the players always play the best move available. For `x` that means the move that maximises the score, for `o` that means the move that minimises the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets go back a move:\n",
    "```\n",
    "o|x|x\n",
    " |x|o\n",
    "o| |\n",
    "```\n",
    "How do we assign a score? It is the turn of `x` and they have three choices:\n",
    "```\n",
    "o|x|x    o|x|x    o|x|x\n",
    "x|x|o     |x|o     |x|o\n",
    "o| |     o|x|     o| |x\n",
    "```\n",
    "If we assume the score is defined for each of these states then naturally `x` will play the move associated with ending in the highest scoring state.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know the score for the middle state is `+1`, as it is a winning state. What about the other two?\n",
    "The score of the left and right states can be calculated in the exact same way as for this state, the one difference being it will then be the turn of `o`, who will want to minimise the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The left state has two choices for `o`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "o|x|x    o|x|x\n",
    "x|x|o    x|x|o\n",
    "o|o|     o| |o\n",
    "```\n",
    "which will be immediately followed by `x` taking the only move it has left and ending the game. On the left this is a draw (score=`0`), and on the right a win for `x` (score=`+1`). `o` wants to minimise so it will choose the left choice - a draw is preferable to a loss. So the left state scores `0` when `x` looks at it, because `x` assumes `o` will do the best they can. The same argument holds for the right choice. So when `x` is taking its move it will always choose the middle option, because it has the highest score, corresponding to victory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern repeats. Going right back to the start of the game `x` will consider every possible game that can be played, all the way to the end. And by assuming that it always takes the best move, and the opposition always takes the best move avaliable to it (worst move for `x` because it's a zero sum game), it can calculate the score for every state as the minimum or maximum of the next move, depending on whose turn it is. The name of the algorithm, minimax, comes from this repeating pattern of selecting the minimum and maximum score.\n",

    "Here are some further explanations:\n",

    "## 1. ASCII art\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be challenging to develop an algorithm without being able to see what it is doing. Your first task is to write a function that visualises the state of the board, using the ascii-art style used above.\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent board states we're going to use a tuple of tuples, so that you may index them with `[row][column]`, where `[0][0]` is the top left and `[2][2]` the bottom right. A space (`' '`) indicates an unused slot, a cross (`'x'`) somewhere the first player played, a circle (`'o'`) somewhere the second player played.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to call the `print()` function for each row of output. You will find that the `print()` function inserts spaces between every item you provide it. This is because the default parameter to the `sep` keyword parameter is `' '` - you will want to change it to `''`. Alternatively, you can use `.format()` or `f''`; there are other approaches as well! (if you want to `print()` without a new line add the keyword parameter `end=''`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    " * Remember to indent your code, to tell python that the `print()` statements belong to the function.\n",
    " * The `pass` keyword means _do nothing_. It is only there as 'filler', so Python does not complain about an empty function if you run this code before finishing the function. You may delete it - it is mostly used to indicate where code is missing.\n",
    " * The 'pipe' symbol used above is typed (using a UK keyboard) by holding down shift and hitting the key to the immediate right of shift. You can c&p from the examples if you can't find it on your keyboard.\n",
